# Sobel-and-Dct
In this repository, I followed the idea from paper&lt;REAL-TIME MOTION DETECTION BASED ON DISCRETE COSINE TRANSFORM> and made a simple edition of the "DCT--high pass filtering--IDCT" step.

## Usage
To get the sobel results of images, run sobel_all.py

`python sobel_all.py`

To get the result of "DCT--high pass filtering--IDCT" part, run vdct_all.py.

`python vdct_all.py`
